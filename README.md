Improved AppImage of cemu **independent of the host libc** which makes able to work on very very old distros as well as musl-libc distros like alpine linux. 

* [Latest Stable Release](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Cemu-AppImage-Enhanced/releases/latest)

---

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i cemu-enhanced` or `appman -i cemu-enhanced`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install cemu-enhanced.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install cemu-enhanced`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)
